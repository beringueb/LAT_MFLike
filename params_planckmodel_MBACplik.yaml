# Foregrounds parameters fitting the planck model (different templates than DR4) to MBAC + plik data.
# xi is fixed to 0.1 (mean of the prior) as it is unconstrained.
# beta_p and beta_c are forced to take the same value in the fit.
# I don't include dust parameters as this will depend on the mask used
# tSZ is normalized at 143 GHz as this is what was doen in planck, this has been reflected in the fg model
